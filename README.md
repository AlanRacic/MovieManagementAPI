# MovieManagementAPI — ASP.NET Core Web API + MVC Client

## Overview  
MovieManagementAPI is a two-tier movie management system consisting of a RESTful ASP.NET Core Web API and an MVC client application that consumes the API.  
The project demonstrates API design, DTO usage, async/await workflows, clean separation of concerns, and distributed architecture with a dedicated client UI.
